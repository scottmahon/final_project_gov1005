# mlb_stat_analysis
Project Summary
This project aims to provide a more in depth understanding on which mlb metrics lead to greater wins. While it is not an exhaistive 
list, it compares how one statistic impacts win vs. another, and by doing so, highlights the most important factors for winning
games. The data was hand scraped and is from 2010-2019, to provide a more modern take on the MLB.
